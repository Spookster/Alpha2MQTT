Register Changes:
- REG_PV_METER_R_TOTAL_ENERGY_CONSUMED_FROM_GRID_1 should have been multiplied by 0.01
- REG_PV_METER_R_TOTAL_ENERGY_FEED_TO_GRID_1 should have been multiplied by 0.01
- REG_GRID_METER_R_TOTAL_ENERGY_FEED_TO_GRID_1 should have been multiplied by 0.01
- REG_GRID_METER_R_TOTAL_ENERGY_CONSUMED_FROM_GRID_1 should have been multiplied by 0.01
- REG_CUSTOM_GRID_CURRENT_A_PHASE is a new register to derive current from Grid Power / Grid Voltage (Phase A)
